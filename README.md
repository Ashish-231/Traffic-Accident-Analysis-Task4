# Traffic Accident Analysis (Task 4)

📌 **Data Science Internship – SkillCraft Technology**

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify:
- 🚦 Road condition impact (signals, stops, roundabouts)
- 🌦️ Weather impact on accidents
- 🕒 Time-of-day accident patterns
- 🔥 Accident severity distribution
- 🗺️ Hotspot visualization using Folium heatmaps

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Folium (for geospatial visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Output
- Accident trend visualizations
- Heatmaps of accident hotspots
- Severity vs time-of-day analysis

## 📂 Files
- ![Task_4](Task_4.ipynb) – Jupyter Notebook
- ![Accident Dataset](Accident_Sample.csv) - Dataset Used
  ⚠️ Note: The full dataset is too large to upload on GitHub.  
A sample dataset (5000 rows) is provided for testing the notebook.
